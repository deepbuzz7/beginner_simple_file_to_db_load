# Simple script to load data from file to database
This is super simple dockerized script for beginners which loads the data from the file to postgres database. This is intended to give a starting point on how to load the data from a file to database.

In order to execute the script, go into the repository and run ```docker-compose up```. It will build the image and run it.

Note: goodreads_data.csv is a dataset randomly taken from Kaggle. Then, on the basis of that, table design is created wich can be seen in table_design.png file.

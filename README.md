# Simple script to load data from file to database
This is a super simple dockerized script for beginners which loads the data from a file to a postgres database. This is intended to give a starting point on how to load the data from a file to a database.

In order to execute the script, go into the repository and run ```docker-compose up```. It will build the image and run it.

Note: goodreads_data.csv is a dataset randomly taken from Kaggle. On the basis of that, table design is created which can be seen in table_design.png file.
